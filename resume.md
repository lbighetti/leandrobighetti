I am a Software Developer with 7 years of experience. I believe in the power of heavy test automation, small releases and frequent deployments.

I'm an active proponent of Elixir, I love the power of the Erlang ecosystem, how data immutability and the actor model makes it easier to reason about concurrency. 

My development side projects include my YouTube channel which has been featured in the Elixir community multiple times. I am also the maintainer of Elixir/Phoenix Real World project.
