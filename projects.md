## LittleAlchemist.io
>Creator

[LittleAlchemist.io](https://www.youtube.com/littlealchemistio) is a YouTube channel focused on Elixir screencast tutorials.

## Real World - Elixir/Phoenix
>Maintainer

[Real World](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) is an exemplary fullstack Medium.com clone, implemented independently in different backend and frontend tecnologies, adhering to the same API spec. Because of that you can mix and match different frontends and backends.

While most "todo" demos provide an excellent cursory glance at a framework's capabilities, they typically don't convey the knowledge & perspective required to actually build real applications with it.

RealWorld solves this by allowing you to choose any of the available frontends and backends and see how they power a real world, beautifully designed fullstack app called "Conduit".

I'm the maintainter of the [Elixir/Phoenix backend](https://github.com/gothinkster/elixir-phoenix-realworld-example-app)
